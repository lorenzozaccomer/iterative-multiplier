# Iterative Multiplier

Project for Electronic Calculators course.

The objective was the design of an iterative multiplier, described in VHDL language; this having a 2-bit multiplier automatically synthesised by the synthesis tool, and exploiting it to obtain the desired multiplier, first a 16-bit output unit, and then a 64-bit unit, by parametrization.

### Documentation

Files:
- Iterative_Multiplier__SOFTWARE.pdf
- (folder) images: some screen about the simulation with ModelSim
- (folder) report: reports generated via Xilinx ISE  
- (folder) software: advice to install Xilinx ISE on your computer

### Code

Contain all the file for the iterative multiplier
- (folder) modules: all the module's file for the iterative multiplier
- (folder) standard multiplier: simple multiplier loaded via ModelSim used to test the result of the iterative multiplier
