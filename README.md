# Iterative Multiplier

Project for Electronic Calculators course.

The goal was to design an iterative multiplier with two inputs, described in the VHDL language, with a 2-bit multiplier automatically synthesised by the synthesis tool and used to obtain the desired multiplier, first a 16-bit output unit and then a 64-bit unit, by parameterisation.

### Documentation

Folders:
- images: some screen about the simulation with ModelSim
- report: generated via Xilinx ISE  
- software: advice to install Xilinx ISE on your computer
- asm chart: contain all the execution graph

### Code

Contain all the file for the iterative multiplier
- (folder) modules: all the module's file for the iterative multiplier
- (folder) standard multiplier: simple multiplier loaded via ModelSim used to test the result of the iterative multiplier
